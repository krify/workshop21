			<h2>Quality Testing</h2>
			<img src="images/testing.png" alt="" />
			<p>Any product or app built must undergo and pass the testing process to ensure that the quality standards are complied with and are on par with the Client’s needs and International Quality Standards. This quality testing is carried out to keep the patrons informed about the quality of the product being created. In the process of doing so, multiple testing techniques are adopted to evaluate the status and identify possible risks during the implementation stage of software. The testing team works closely with Software development team and informs them if any bugs are identified, and the development works on fixing the same.</p>

			<h2>UX & UI Designs</h2>
			<img src="images/mockupcreation.png" alt="" />
			<p>UX Design refers to the term User Experience Design, while UI Design stands for User Interface Design. Both elements are vital to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are completely different, referring to very various elements of the process and the design development. Where UX Design is a more analytical and technical field which we also called Mock ups, UI Design is closer to what we refer to as graphic design, though the responsibilities are somewhat more difficult.</p>
