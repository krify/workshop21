<h1>UX & UI Designs</h1>
</div>

<div class="uiuxcontent">
UX Design refers to the term User Experience Design, while UI Design stands for User Interface Design. Both elements are vital to a product and work closely together. But despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are completely different, referring to very various elements of the process and the design development. Where UX Design is a more analytical and technical field which we also called Mock ups, UI Design is closer to what we refer to as graphic design, though the responsibilities are somewhat more difficult.

</div>

<div class="uiuxcontent">
A Mockup is a design of an idea or thought conceived intellectually. It also is used as a tool to demonstrate, assess and present a concept or a plan in order to win a project or deal. Mockup is a prototype which forms the base of a system and design of a product, used to acquire the feedback of prospective clients and users. These mockups can also be utilized to understand the responsiveness of the customers.

      <div id="page1" style="display: block;" class="uiuxcontent">Ninjamock is a first of its kind tool which gives a visual shape to your ideas conceived intellectually, using anything you draw with a freehand or any shape or any path. Ninjamock makes all this happen as it consists of a vector editor. It has most of the important templates required for creating prototypes for webs and mobiles. We made the best use of Ninjamock for creating many of our apps which are compatible with Android, iPad, iPhone, etc.</div>
      <div id="page2" style="display: none;" class="uiuxcontent">Mockflow is another online tool introduced for designing and collaborating UI mockups for distinct apps, software and websites. It assists in envisaging the interface, arrangement and navigation of a website in remarkably lesser time than usual. You have the following advantages with mock flows:
You can draw or code wireframes in a jiffy
You can capture any visual thought like a picture
You can send your designs to your prospective clients instantaneously</div>
